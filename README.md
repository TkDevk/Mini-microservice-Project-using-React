- The concept of Terminating an EC2 instance is completely different from stopping them. Terminating is when you donâ€™t need an instance and want to delete it completely from your AWS infrastructure which cannot be recovered. However, if you have an AWS snapshot, you can create an AWS AMI that will enable you to restore an instance to the date when you created the snapshot.

# How to deploy Express server on AWS lambda

-install dependencies
`npm i serverless-http`

-import serverless

`const serverless = require("serverless-http");`

-I need to add a handler at the bottom to export  my app wrapped in the serverless function

`module.exports.handler=serverless(app);`

-Remove app-listen because it won't work

```js
/*
app.listen(4000,()=>{
    console.log('Listening at post 4000');
})
*/
```
- The base route won't work when the app it's deployed in Lambda Function

- Go to Lambda web service
https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/

- Create Function

- Upload zip file of my code

-Once is submitted i need to ad a trigger

-Trigger Api Gateway

-Create Rest Api > Create Resource > Configure as Proxy request

-Proxy resource it will forward the request to my lambda function

- Proxy resources handle requests to all sub-resources. To create a proxy resource use a path parameter that ends with a plus sign, for example {proxy+}.
